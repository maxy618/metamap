# MetaMap üìç

A simple Python utility for extracting GPS coordinates from image EXIF metadata and generating a Google Maps link.

---

## Features

* Extracts GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) from image EXIF metadata
* Converts DMS (degrees, minutes, seconds) format to decimal
* Generates a direct Google Maps link for the location
* Colorful console output using `termcolor`
* ASCII logo on startup

---

## Example

```bash
python metamap.py path/to/image.jpg
```

Example output:

```
[+] Found coordinates: Latitude: 23.7558, Longitude: 45.6173
